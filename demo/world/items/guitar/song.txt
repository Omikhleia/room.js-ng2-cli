It began on a lone autumn evening:
I was the most clever poet around,
And she was the smartest girl.

She was my friend,
Oh my smart friend,
And my girlfriend? 
Perhaps...

We used to sing so well together,
But it ended a lone autumn evening:
She felt in love with a mucisian.

She was my friend,
Oh my smart friend,
And my girlfriend?
Nevermore.

Our relationship changed,
But still, she is in my thoughts,
My life is a lone autumn evening.
